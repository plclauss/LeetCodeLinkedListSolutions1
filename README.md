# Linked Lists:

---

Unfortunately, there really isn't any new information I can share with you all. Solving these problems seemed like a lot of writing, then rewriting if it failed. Though, the rewritten problems didn't fail because of some obscure concept with linked lists in C++; it was more so things like "Oh, I messed up the indexing on my while-loop." A quick plus-or-minus-one would fix the issue, and that was that.

I will say, though, linked lists are...weird. They feel like limited arrays. I understand their usefulness in that their memory does not need to be sequential, but because of this, they can sometimes be more difficult to perform operations on. I oftentimes found myself using other data structures (vectors and maps) as aids to these problems, which you can see in the solution file. It honestly felt like cheating, and I'm not entirely sure if this is frowned upon, but either way, my solutions worked.

*Note: It was sometimes easier to sort a linked list first before doing anything else to it. Since I haven't learned any efficient sorting algorithms yet, I stuck with importing C++'s algorithm library, in order to use `std::sort()`.*
